"""Read-only network diagnostics for Xbox/Minecraft connectivity.

The checks in this module deliberately do not mutate host networking.  In
particular, a UDP ``connect`` or an unanswered datagram cannot establish that
a remote RakNet port is open, so LAN diagnostics only inspect the route to a
caller-supplied, validated IP address.
