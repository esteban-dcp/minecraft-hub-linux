"""bol.presence — tell Xbox Live the account is playing (#238, #243).

Minecraft under Wine never says it is running. Measured against a live
account, straight after a full launch, the presence service still answered

    {"state":"Offline",
     "lastSeen":{"titleName":"Minecraft Launcher","timestamp":"…12 days ago"}}

which is the whole of the report: the player's own card reads "Offline" in
the dressing room and in the social tab, and their friends never see them in
Minecraft. Presence is written by XSAPI on Windows, and XSAPI is the layer
that does not come up under Wine, so nothing writes it and no amount of
reading fixes it -- the game reads its own presence back correctly, and what
it reads is the truth.

The write the real client makes is a single POST, to an audience the
launcher already holds a token for (the ``http://xboxlive.com`` XSTS token
pre-auth mints for Friends/Social):

    POST userpresence.xboxlive.com/users/xuid(<xuid>)/devices/current/titles/current
    Authorization: XBL3.0 x=<uhs>;<token>
    X-Xbl-Contract-Version: 3
    {"state": "active"}

The title is deliberately not named in the body. The service takes it from
the token's own title claim -- sending an ``id`` is answered 400
ArgumentError -- and reports "Minecraft". So this can say only that Minecraft
is being played, by the account that is playing it, and cannot be pointed at
another title.

A session is taken down on the way out, and Xbox lets an unfed record decay
on its own besides -- measured to "Away" within seven minutes -- so a
launcher that is killed mid-game cannot leave anyone showing as playing for
long. That decay is also what ``HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`` is chosen to stay inside.

Nothing here may raise into a launch, and nothing here gates one: presence is
what other people see, never whether the game runs.
