"""bol.navigation — drive the launcher window with a game controller (Qt).

`bol.gamepad` turns a controller into logical actions; this module turns those
actions into a moving focus ring over the PySide6 window, so the whole
launcher — PLAY, the version picker, sign-in, every Settings switch — can be
operated without a mouse. That is the difference between the launcher being a
five-second stop and being a dead end on a Steam Deck or any Game Mode session,
where the launcher deliberately still opens before the game.

This is the Qt rewrite of the customtkinter-era ring, which was removed with
the old toolkit because it was built entirely on Tk internals. The geometry —
`choose_neighbour`, `reading_order`, `within` — is the part that was never
about a toolkit and is unchanged; everything that touches a widget is new, and
in most cases smaller, because Qt already knows how to do it:

* `QScrollArea.ensureWidgetVisible` replaces a hand-rolled scroll-into-view;
* `QApplication.activePopupWidget()` and `activeModalWidget()` say what is on
  top, so a dropdown or a dialog confines the ring with nothing to register;
* a `QListWidget`, a `QLineEdit` and a `QTabBar` already navigate themselves
  from arrow keys, so the ring hands those the key rather than reimplementing
  them.

The ring itself is an overlay widget that paints an outline over the target and
nothing else. The Tk version had to reconfigure each widget's own border and
put it back afterwards; here nothing about the target is touched, which is why
a switch, a painted gear and a bare clickable frame all light up the same way.

What counts as a control is discovered, not declared: the widget tree of
whatever is on top is walked on each press. Qt answers most of it (a
`QAbstractButton` is a button), and the launcher's hand-made controls — the
version pill, the profile and account chips — are frames with a pointing-hand
cursor, which is exactly what they look like to a user and so is what they are
treated as here.

Two deliberate restraints, carried over because they were right:

* the ring stays hidden until a controller is actually used, and disappears
  again on the first mouse movement, so a mouse user never sees it;
* actions are dropped while the window is hidden or Minecraft is running,
  because the controller keeps reporting to whoever is listening and the
  launcher is still alive behind the game.

That second test deliberately does not ask whether the launcher holds the
input focus, which is the obvious way to write it. A window manager that
refuses focus to a window it did not see the user open — focus-stealing
prevention, focus-follows-mouse with the pointer elsewhere, a kiosk session —
would then leave the controller doing nothing at all, and the user has no
mouse with which to fix it.
