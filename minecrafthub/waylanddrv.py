"""bol.waylanddrv — report whether the engine's Wayland driver can load.

The engine is a hybrid: a reviewed GE-Proton base with our own WineGDK build
overlaid on top. The overlay only replaces the modules that build produced, so
a module Wine's configure quietly dropped does not leave a hole in the
candidate — the base's own module survives in its place, one Wine major
version behind everything around it.

That is what happened to ``winewayland.drv`` (issue #180). The build container
lacked ``libxkbregistry-dev``, configure disabled the Wayland driver without
failing, and the shipped engine ended up with GE-Proton's Wine 10 driver next
to our Wine 11 ``win32u.so``. Wine 11 no longer exports the
``win32u_(get|set)_window_pixel_format`` entry points that driver imports, so
it fails its ``PROCESS_ATTACH`` on an undefined symbol and no window is ever
created — ``BOL_INPUT=wayland`` could not start the game on any host.

Detection is a byte search, like the ntsync probe: Wine's TRACE and ERR macros
put each module's source path in its ``.rodata``, so a module carries the tree
it was compiled from. Two modules of one Wine build share that tree; a
leftover from another build does not. Nothing is loaded, no Wine process is
started and no graphics library is opened, so this can run before a launch.
