"""bol.perfcheck — name the conditions behind "the game lags" before launch.

Every check here answers the same report, and none of them leaves a trace in
a Wine, Proton or vkd3d log, which is why they get blamed on the GPU:

* the host has no memory left, so the kernel pages the game out and every
  chunk the player walks into comes back through a major fault;
* the data directory is nearly full, so the shader cache cannot grow and
  vkd3d recompiles pipelines that should have been reused;
* Minecraft presents with vsync into a window, so a compositing desktop adds
  a frame of latency on top of the game's own and the pacing wobbles;
* the render distance is set past what the main thread can feed — by a wide
  margin the largest frame-time cost in Bedrock, since the chunk ring the
  main thread walks grows with the square of the distance;
* Minecraft's own *Max Framerate* limiter waits by polling for window
  messages, which under Wine holds the main thread at a full CPU core.

Detection is cheap and side-effect free, in the same spirit as bol.ntsync and
bol.dgc: two ``/proc/meminfo`` fields, one ``statvfs``, and Minecraft's own
options.txt parsed out of the prefix. No Wine process is started, no Vulkan
or GPU is touched and nothing is written, so this can run before every
launch.

Every threshold below is deliberately set past the values people actually
play at: an advisory that fires on a healthy machine is one users learn to
ignore, and then it is worth nothing on the machine that really is starved.
