    With vsync off and *Max Framerate* on Unlimited nothing paces the render
    loop, and the main menu — the cheapest frame in the game — then runs into
    four figures of FPS and takes most of the GPU to display a still image
    (issue #150). vkd3d-proton's own limiter is the right place to stop that:
    it sleeps until the frame deadline instead of spinning, and it applies to
    every frame the game presents, menu included.

    Only the genuinely unpaced case is capped, and only at the refresh rate of
    the fastest display attached, so a player who set either of Minecraft's
    own limits keeps exactly what they chose and nobody loses a frame they
    could have seen.

    Two things override that, in order. ``BOL_FRAME_RATE`` wins outright,
    since it is the only one that can name a rate: 0 never caps, a number
    always caps at it, whatever the game and the switch say. Callers pass
    ``environ`` with the Advanced custom-environment field overlaid, since
    that field is where it is documented and it is applied too late in the
    launch to be visible here. Failing that, the *Limit the frame rate to the
    display* switch in Settings decides whether the automatic cap applies at
    all; it is on by default, because the uncapped menu is a bug report and
    not a preference.

    The limit is always whole frames per second, rounded up. That is not
    cosmetic: a value carrying a decimal point is parsed as no limit at all
    and silently does nothing, so a 143.85 Hz display has to be asked for as
    144 — and rounding up rather than down is what keeps the cap from landing
