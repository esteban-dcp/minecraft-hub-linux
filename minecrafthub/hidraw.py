"""bol.hidraw - keep non-controller hidraw devices out of Wine's HID stack.

winebus opens every ``/dev/hidraw`` node the user can open except keyboards,
touchscreens and the controllers it would rather take through SDL: a mouse or
a vendor-defined collection is enough to be taken over. Most hidraw nodes are
root-only, but the ones that ship ``uaccess`` udev rules for their Linux
tools are not -- AIO coolers, fan and RGB controllers, a receiver's HID++
channel, headsets.

Some of those send input reports longer than their own report descriptor
declares (an NZXT 1e71:1714 fan controller declares 21 bytes and sends 64),
and Wine trusts the descriptor twice: winebus's ``deliver_next_report``
copies the whole report into a read buffer hidclass sized from the
descriptor's largest input report, and hidclass's ``hid_device_queue_input``
copies it again into a per-collection buffer of the declared size. The
corrupted heap crashes ``winedevice.exe`` on every start, and that process
hosts the entire HID stack -- hidclass, winebus and Wine's virtual mouse and
keyboard with them. GameInput then has no mouse at all: no hover, no clicks,
while the keyboard, which does not depend on that stack, keeps working.

Minecraft needs none of these devices. The mouse and keyboard reach it
through Wine's own virtual HID devices, and controllers are left exactly as
Wine would have them. Every other device Wine could open gets winebus's
per-device option ``Devices\\<vid>/<pid>`` → ``Hidraw`` = 0, so it never does.
``BOL_HIDRAW=all`` restores Wine's default for those devices.
