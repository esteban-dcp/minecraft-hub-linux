"""bol.raytracing — report what the graphics stack granted Minecraft.

Issue #153 asked why Minecraft "refuses to acknowledge the ray tracing
capabilities" of an RDNA4 card, and there was no way to answer it: nothing on
either side of the launch writes down whether the game was handed DXR at all.
The launcher's *Ray tracing* switch only removes an inherited
``VKD3D_CONFIG=nodxr`` — the tier itself is decided inside the game process by
vkd3d-proton, from the Vulkan features the driver exposes, and that decision
was thrown away.

It is not thrown away any more: every launch now runs the graphics payload at
its ``info`` level, which states the outcome in a handful of lines at device
creation, and this module reads them back out of the log afterwards. Nothing
here opens a GPU device or starts a Wine process — it reads state a previous
launch already produced, the same rule the rest of the GPU reporting follows.

What the log says, and what it means for Minecraft:

- ``DXR 1.1 support enabled.`` — the tier Minecraft's Ray Traced graphics mode
  needs. Tier 1.0 alone is *not* enough for the mode to become selectable, and
  no tier at all means the driver exposed no Vulkan ray tracing.
- ``DX Ultimate supported!`` — mesh shaders, sampler feedback and VRS on top,
  which is what a Windows "DirectX 12 Ultimate" device reports.
- ``Enabling fast paths for advanced ExecuteIndirect() … (NV_dgc|EXT_dgc)`` —
  which half of the universal device-generated-commands payload the driver
  took, the thing the main menu depends on.

A tier reported here is what the *device* offered. Minecraft additionally
requires a ray-tracing-capable world before it will let the mode be selected,
and that condition is the game's, not the driver's.
