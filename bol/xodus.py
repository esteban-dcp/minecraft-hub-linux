"""bol.xodus — Minecraft acquisition through the Xodus CLI.

Xodus (https://github.com/xodus-gaming/xodus, GPL-3.0) is how the launcher gets
Minecraft: it signs in to the user's own Microsoft account, asks Microsoft's
licensing service for the title license — which carries the content key — then
streams the MSIXVC package from the official Xbox CDN and decrypts it on the
fly. It replaced a third-party repository that redistributed a DRM-stripped
copy of the game, so the account now has to actually own Minecraft.

Everything here shells out to the ``xodus-cli`` binary; no Xodus code is
linked. See third_party/xodus/README.md for the pin and the licensing note.

    URLs the index carries for one build. The mirrors are the same package on
    different Microsoft asset hosts, so a body one of them cuts short is worth
    asking the next one for.

    ``xodus-cli streaming`` is incremental and commits atomically on its own:
    it compares the local segment hashes against the remote package, fetches
    only the changed files, and renames its work package into place at the end.
    So there is deliberately no staging/rollback dance around it here — adding
    one would defeat the delta and re-download the whole 2+ GiB every time.
    What it does need is _drop_cache(): the delta is a shortcut only while the
    cache it reads belongs to a build that is really there.

    A fresh install is also measured against the free space first. Everything
    xodus-cli needs lands in ``dest``: the package it streams through, and the
    build decrypted out of it -- 2.32 GiB of game beside a 187 MiB cache for
    1.26.44.3 -- so the package's own Content-Length is a fair figure for
    both, and it is one HEAD away. Without that check a disk with a few
    hundred MiB left produced two failures that named neither the disk nor the
    room: the cache write was refused mid-parse and xodus-cli panicked on the
    short read, and once the cache was dropped the next attempt got as far as
    xodus-cli's own space check, which prints its verdict and exits 0.

    A short cache read on a disk that has the room is not the disk at all but
    xodus-cli racing its own write (see _CACHE_SHORT), and that is worth
    simply running again: a fresh attempt re-reads only the prefix the parse
    needs rather than the whole build.

    the wrapper replaces with the NT name Xodus assigns.

    runtime in *that* environment -- and so does the Xodus home holding the
