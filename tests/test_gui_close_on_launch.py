"""Closing the launcher when the game starts, without abandoning the session.

The window is the only thing the setting takes away. The process behind it
still has to see the launch out: it armed a GPU safety marker before starting
the game, and a marker nobody watches return blocks the next launch until a
reboot. These tests pin the decision and the wiring that keeps that true.

The Qt rewrite moved this from one long Tk closure (do_play.work) into a
QThread subclass (LaunchWorker) whose UI-facing steps go through Qt signals
instead of a scheduling call like Tk's root.after -- Qt queues cross-thread
signal delivery onto the GUI thread itself, so LaunchWorker.run() must never
touch window widgets directly, only emit.
