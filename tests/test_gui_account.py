"""The accounts menu: two sign-ins, one at a time, and questions that expire.

The launcher needs two separate Microsoft sessions -- one to play online, one
to download the game -- and they used to live in two different places with
nothing saying they were different accounts at all. They share a menu now, so
these cover both, plus the two properties the menu has to keep: a device-code
flow that cannot be started twice, and a "Sign out?" that cannot outlive the
menu that asked it.
