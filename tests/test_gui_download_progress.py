"""What the window says while Minecraft comes down from Microsoft.

The download is a single 2.3 GiB package, and both halves of the machinery
that used to report it counted in C++ ints: a Qt `int` in the worker's signal,
and the QProgressBar's own range. PySide6 wraps anything past 2 GiB into that
with nothing louder than a RuntimeWarning, so the total arrived negative,
`max(1, total)` turned it into 1, and the status line multiplied the byte
count by a hundred — "Downloading Minecraft…  24346886100%" on a bar that had
been full since the first chunk (issue #216).

These tests use the real figures from that report, so they fail on any signal
or widget that is narrower than the download it carries.
