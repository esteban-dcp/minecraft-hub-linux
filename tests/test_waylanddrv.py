"""Keep the engine's Wayland driver part of the engine's own Wine build.

The engine is a GE-Proton base with our WineGDK build overlaid, and the
overlay only replaces what that build produced. Debian 11 splits xkbregistry
out of libxkbcommon-dev, the build container installed only the latter, and
Wine's configure dropped winewayland.drv without failing. Nothing was missing
from the candidate afterwards -- the base's own Wine 10 driver had simply
survived beside our Wine 11 win32u.so, importing the
win32u_(get|set)_window_pixel_format exports Wine removed in 2025. It failed
its PROCESS_ATTACH on every host, so BOL_INPUT=wayland could never start the
game (issue #180).
