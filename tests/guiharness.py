"""A real MainWindow with nothing reaching outside the process.

Not collected by pytest (the filename does not match test_*.py). Shared by
the GUI test modules so none of them has to import another one for it.

The point of the patch list is that MainWindow.__init__ does real work:
it arms singleShot timers for refresh_versions and the update check, calls
xodus.signed_in() while building Settings, and installs itself as the global
log sink. Any test that runs the event loop would otherwise reach the
network, and the sink would outlive the window it writes to.

`store_signed_in` is the download account's state. It defaults to signed out
so a test says what it wants rather than inheriting whatever Microsoft Store
session the developer happens to have on the machine running the suite.
