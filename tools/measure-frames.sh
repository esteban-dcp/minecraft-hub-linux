# Measure Minecraft's frame pacing and Wine synchronization cost while you play.
#
# Launches the game through the normal launcher with the Mesa Vulkan overlay
# logging frame times, samples the wineserver's synchronization round-trips and
# the GPU alongside it, and prints a summary when you close the game.
#
# Nothing is installed and no setting is changed: the overlay is an explicit
# Vulkan layer enabled per-process through the environment, and everything is
# written below one report directory.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/measure-frames.sh [LABEL]
#
# Play normally once the game is up — load a world, fly around to force chunk
# generation, open the settings screens. The report separates the first minute
# (pipeline compilation warming up) from the rest, because those are two
# different problems: compilation stutter fades as caches fill, whereas the
# wineserver round-trip cost does not.
