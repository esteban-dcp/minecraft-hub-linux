#
# Xodus (https://github.com/xodus-gaming/xodus, GPL-3.0) is what replaced the
# third-party archive repository the launcher used to pull the game from: it
# signs in to the user's own Microsoft account, obtains the title license, and
# streams the MSIXVC package from the official Xbox CDN. See
# third_party/xodus/README.md.
#
# The commit is read from bol/config.py (XODUS_SOURCE_COMMIT) so the pin lives
# in exactly one place. Prints the resulting XODUS_REV + SHA-256 to pin back
# into bol/config.py.
