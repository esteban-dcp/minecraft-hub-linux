# Build the OpenSSL-XCurl online-login set entirely from pinned public sources:
#   - the msys2 MinGW curl package + its runtime dependency closure, each pinned
#     by exact filename + SHA-256 in third_party/xcurl-msys2.lock,
#   - the CA-injecting shim compiled from src/xcurl-cashim.c,
#   - the cryptbase RNG stub compiled from src/cryptbase-stub.c,
# then package it with scripts/package-openssl-xcurl.sh. Prints the resulting
# OPENSSL_XCURL_REV + SHA-256 to pin into bol/config.py.
#
# With the lockfile present the build is byte-reproducible (fixed package set +
# deterministic, timestamp-free DLLs). Regenerate the lock by deleting it and
# re-running (resolves current msys2), e.g. when a pinned package rotates off
# the mirror; then re-pin config to the new rev/SHA.
#
# No opaque prebuilt binary is used: the runtime DLLs are stock msys2 packages
# (verified by SHA), and the two DLLs the Bedrock GDK needs are built from source.
